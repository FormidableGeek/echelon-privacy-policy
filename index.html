    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Application Name:</strong> Echelon</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> LearnRight Educational Consult</p>
    <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://learnrightconsult.com/" target="_blank">https://learnrightconsult.com/</a></p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 14, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      LearnRight Educational Consult (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values the trust of our users. 
      This Privacy Policy describes how the <em>Echelon</em> mobile application (“App”) 
      handles user information, data, and privacy. Our priority is to ensure that you 
      can use Echelon with confidence, knowing that your information remains private.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to all individuals who download, install, or use the 
      Echelon application on any compatible device. It covers our practices regarding 
      the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> refers to any information that can identify an individual, such as name, email address, or phone number.</li>
      <li><strong>“Non-Personal Data”</strong> refers to technical or anonymous information that cannot identify an individual, such as aggregated statistics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      Echelon does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any Personal Data or Non-Personal Data from its users.  
      Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No registration or login is required.</li>
      <li>No personal identifiers are collected.</li>
      <li>No gameplay data is stored on external servers.</li>
      <li>No background tracking or analytics tools are used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Echelon does not request or require access to sensitive device permissions such as 
      contacts, camera, microphone, location, or storage. If future versions of the App 
      request permissions for functional improvements, they will be disclosed clearly, 
      and users will be asked to provide explicit consent.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Echelon is suitable for all ages, including children and students. Since no data 
      is collected, there is no risk of unauthorized use of children’s information. 
      Parents and guardians can be assured that the App is safe for educational use.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Although no user data is collected, we are committed to following industry best 
      practices to ensure that the App remains secure and free from vulnerabilities 
      that could compromise your privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International Use</h2>
    <p>
      Echelon is available to users worldwide. Regardless of where the App is accessed, 
      it operates under this Privacy Policy, ensuring that no user data is collected 
      or shared across jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <h2>9. User Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Because no data is collected, there are no stored records for users to access, 
      modify, or delete. Should future updates introduce optional data features, users 
      will be informed of their rights to access, correct, or erase such data in line 
      with applicable data protection laws.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Echelon does not use any third-party advertising networks, analytics providers, 
      or external integrations that track or collect information about users.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect updates 
      in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. Any modifications will be 
      posted on this page with an updated “Effective Date.”
    </p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
      the Federal Republic of Nigeria, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
    </p>
